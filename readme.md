# Game design doc

**Description**

The idea for this game is you are a roadie cleaning up after a metal show just ended. Your buddies and co-workers got a bit ahead on the after party, 
so are having some trouble holding the truck still. Toss everything in to pack up the gear safely. Miss and break something, and the band will
not be happy with you.

## Game layout

- 2d side view.
- Player is on the left side, standing on a platform.
- Targets are on the right

## Art

Art done as basic vector (maybe use open game art), use darker colours for the background (night time). Use colours for the gear that make sense,
keep a metal theme in mind.

## Music

Metal shows have metal music playing in background before & after, so need to write some actual music here.
